## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Question 1

```{r}
## Step 1 and Step 2
file <- scale(t(read.csv("/Users/andrewguo/Desktop/Ch10Ex11.csv", header = FALSE)))

## Step 3
file_dist <- dist(file, method = "euclidean")

## Step 4
hc_complete <- hclust(file_dist, method = 'complete')
hc_single <- hclust(file_dist, method = 'single')
hc_average <- hclust(file_dist, method = 'average')

## Step 5 and Step 6
matrix(c(sum(cutree(hc_complete, 2)[1:20] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_complete, 2)[1:20] == 2), sum(cutree(hc_complete, 2)[21:40] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_complete, 2)[21:40] == 2)), ncol = 2)
matrix(c(sum(cutree(hc_single, 2)[1:20] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_single, 2)[1:20] == 2), sum(cutree(hc_single, 2)[21:40] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_single, 2)[21:40] == 2)), ncol = 2)
matrix(c(sum(cutree(hc_average, 2)[1:20] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_average, 2)[1:20] == 2), sum(cutree(hc_average, 2)[21:40] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_average, 2)[21:40] == 2)), ncol = 2)
```

## Question 2

```{r}
## Step 3
file_dist2 <- amap::Dist(file, method = 'correlation')

## Step 4
hc_complete2 <- hclust(file_dist2, method = 'complete')
hc_single2 <- hclust(file_dist2, method = 'single')
hc_average2 <- hclust(file_dist2, method = 'average')

## Step 5 and Step 6
matrix(c(sum(cutree(hc_complete2, 2)[1:20] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_complete2, 2)[1:20] == 2), sum(cutree(hc_complete2, 2)[21:40] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_complete2, 2)[21:40] == 2)), ncol = 2)
matrix(c(sum(cutree(hc_single2, 2)[1:20] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_single2, 2)[1:20] == 2), sum(cutree(hc_single2, 2)[21:40] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_single2, 2)[21:40] == 2)), ncol = 2)
matrix(c(sum(cutree(hc_average2, 2)[1:20] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_average2, 2)[1:20] == 2), sum(cutree(hc_average2, 2)[21:40] == 1), sum(cutree(hc_average2, 2)[21:40] == 2)), ncol = 2)
```
